Download either the binary or source from http://phantomjs.org/download.html

Currently tested with version `1.9.1`
At least version `1.8.1` is needed (`1.9.1` on Windows)

If you download the source:
 - Compiling can take at least an hour.
 - Place the compiled binary in the `libs/phantomjs/` directory

If you download the precompiled binary
 - Add the location of the binary file to your PATH, or
 - Extract the binary file to `libs/phantomjs/` or `libs/phantomjs/bin`
